Hi Team,

I have created two solutions for the problem:
#### Solution 1: worst_case_Solution.java
* Time Complexity : O(n^3)
#### Steps:
1. Take the user input to find pairs within the range.
2. Declare the count variable, this will take care about the range.
3. Use three pointer loops to get values for x, y and Z.
4. Add the condition for which we are finding pairs that is : x^2+y^2=Z^2
5. If the condition get passed we increase the count variable.

#### Solution 2: Optimized_solution.java
* Time Complexity : O(n^2)
#### Steps:
1. Take the user input to find pairs within the range.
2. Declare the count variable, this will take care about the range.
3. Use 2 pointer loops to get values for x and y.
4. In this Solution for  finding the value of z, Just sum the squre of x and y.
5. Then, take the aqure root of sum and match with the squre of z.
6. If the condition get passed then increase the counter variable by 2.

#### Thanks
